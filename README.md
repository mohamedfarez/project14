Face and eye detection

Captures video from the default camera and detects faces and eyes in the video stream.

The script uses the OpenCV library to capture video from the default camera, convert the frames to grayscale, and then use pre-trained Haar Cascade classifiers to detect faces and eyes in the video stream. 
The detected faces and eyes are then highlighted with rectangles in the video output.

The script runs in a loop until the user presses the 'Esc' key (ASCII code 27) to exit.
